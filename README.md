# PROJECT OBJECTIVE
	Travelling is a passion for many people. Where to visit an what to truly expect at places are always an added concern for them. Information provided by officials may not always be satisfactory. In such situations they always prefer Reviews. Travellers thus refer to people who visited such places as they help choose the best destination out of all. But, they get information from a limited number of persons only, which may lead to misconceptions about places. Also, Reviews can change from person to person and it is necessary that the person gets correct information about the place they are expecting to visit. Sometimes, even people only get the actual info about places only when they reach there and wastes their time and enjoyment. This is why the “Travel Guide” is useful. It provides a complete traveler-view of places from its database of reviews without referring any others, from the user’s home itself. It allows the user to add their reviews so that it will also help other users who will use it. The options to modify reviews help correct or add to earlier ones. It helps the user choose the best destination and the option to book hotels at the destination from the best sites makes the travel-setups easier. Overall, this software fulfils the complete requirements of a traveller.
